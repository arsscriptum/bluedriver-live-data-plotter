usually measured at the cylinder head or before the radiator.<br><br>Some vehicles may report a second coolant temperature sensor (ECT 2) - location may vary (for example it may be at the outlet of the thermostat) - the factory manual or a parts diagram for your vehicle should provide more information</td></tr><tr><td>Engine Oil Temperature</td><td>Temperature of the engine oil - sensor may be situated near the oil filter but this location will vary depending on the vehicle</td></tr><tr><td>Ambient Air Temperature</td><td>Air temperature around the vehicle - typically this will be a few degrees below intake temperature</td></tr><tr><td id="pid-ambient-pressure">Barometric Pressure</td><td>Local ambient or atmoshperic pressure around the vehicle displayed as an <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_measurement#Absolute,_gauge_and_differential_pressures_%E2%80%94_zero_reference">absolute</a>&nbsp;</span>value<br><br>Typically ambient pressure will read roughly 101.3 kPa or 14.7 psi, but this will vary depending on your altitude and local conditions</td></tr><tr><td id="pid-accelerator-position">Accelerator Pedal Position</td><td>Position of the driver's accelerator pedal - there may be up to three sensors:<ol><li>Acceledator pedal position D (Sensor #1)</li><li>Acceledator pedal position E (Sensor #2)</li><li>Acceledator pedal position F (Sensor #3)</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>Relative Accelerator Pedal Position</td><td>Accelerator pedal position adjusted for the learned behavior of the vehicle over time.<br><br>Due to scaling, the vehicle may not always report 100% when the pedal is placed to the floor.<br><br>Depending on the vehicle this value may also be the average of multiple position sensors (D, E, F)</td></tr><tr><td>Commanded Throttle Actuator</td><td>The<span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);">&nbsp;<a href="#pid-abs-throttle">throttle position</a></span> requested by the ECM based on <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="#pid-accelerator-position">accelerator pedal position</a></span></td></tr><tr><td>Relative Throttle Position</td><td>Throttle position relative to the "learned" or "adapted" closed position<br><br>Over time throttle behavior can change due to carbon buildup or other factors, some vehicles will monitor this behavior and make adjustments over time to compensate<br><br>For example: Over time carbon builds up in the throttle body and when "fully" closed, the throttle is actually open 5% - in this case the <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="#pid-abs-throttle">absolute throttle positon</a></span> will read 5% while the relative position will read 0%</td></tr><tr><td id="pid-abs-throttle">Absolute Throttle Position</td><td>How 'open' the throttle is - a value of 0% means completely closed while 100% is fully open<br><br>Depending on the vehicle there may be up to four throttle position sensors:<ol><li>TPS A/1 (Labeled "Throttle Position Sensor")</li><li>TPS B/2</li><li>TPS C/3</li><li>TPS D/4</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>Control Module Voltage</td><td>Input voltage at the Engine Control Module<ul><li>Engine off/ignition on this value will show battery voltage</li><li>engine on it will show alternator voltage</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Hybrid Battery Pack Remaining Life</td><td>AKA <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_charge">State of Charge</a></span><br><br>The total charge percent remaining in the hybrid battery pack (individual cell data is not available through standard OBDII data)</td></tr><tr><td>Hybrid/EV Vehicle System Status</td><td>This parameter will report the following (as supported by the vehicle):<ol><li>Hybrid/EV charging state: Either <strong>Charge Sustaining Mode</strong> (CSM - control system is attempting to maintain a constant State Of Charge) or <strong>Charge Depletion Mode</strong> (<span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-depleting">CDM</a></span> - control system is targeting an SOC lower than the current value)<br>Non-PHEVs will always display Charge Sustaining Mode</li><li>Hybrid/EV Battery Voltage: 0 to 1024V</li><li>Hybrid/EV Battery Current: -3300 to 3300 Amps, a negative value indicates that the battery is being charged</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>Calculated Engine Load Value</td><td>A calculated value representing the current percentage of <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="#pid-ref-torque">maximum available engine torque</a></span> being produced (100% at WOT, 0% at key on engine off)</td></tr><tr><td>Absolute Load Value</td><td>A normalized value representing the air mass intake per intake stroke as a percentage<br><br>Calculation: <em>(mass of air in grams per intake stroke) / (mass of air per intake stroke at 100% throttle assuming <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a></span>)</em><br><br><strong>Note:</strong> This datapoint has a reporting range from 0% to 25,700% but naturally aspirated engines will display roughly 0 to 95% while turbo/supercharged motors may show as high as 400%.</td></tr><tr><td>Driver's Demand Engine - Percent Torque</td><td>The percentage of <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="#pid-ref-torque">maximum available engine torque</a>&nbsp;</span>requested by the ECM based on:<ol><li>Accelerator pedal position</li><li>Cruise control</li><li>Transmission</li></ol>External factors such as traction control, abs, etc will not influenece this value</td></tr><tr><td id="pid-actual-torque">Actual Engine - Percent Torque</td><td>Also referred to as Indicated Torque<br><br>This parameter displays the current percentage of total available engine torque and includes the net brake torque produced as well as the <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="#pid-friction-torque">'friction' torque</a></span> required to run the engine at no load.</td></tr><tr><td>Engine Friction -

this is considered to be the 100% value for datapoints such as "Actual Engine Percent Torque" or other parameters that express torque output as a percentage.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> This value is set in the factory and does not reflect changes over time due to wear/aging, aftermarket upgrades/tunes, etc</td></tr><tr><td>Engine Percent Torque Data</td><td>This parameter is used in cases where changes in vehicle/environmental conditions can cause the <span style="color: rgb(44, 130, 201);"><a href="#pid-ref-torque">reference torque</a></span> to change - for example at high altitude a different fuel mapping may be employed which will decrease the total available torque by 80%.<br><br>Up to five different maximum torque ratings may be specified with this datapoint, each rating is numbered 1 through 5.<br><br>The datapoint does not report the reason for the change in maximum rating - a factory manual may be required to determine conditions related to each mapping.</td></tr><tr><td>Auxiliary Input/Output</td><td>This is a composite datapoint that is capable of reporting (if supported by the vehicle):<ol><li>Power Take Off Status: <em>On</em> or <em>Off</em></li><li>Automatic Transmission Status: <em>Park/Netural</em> or <em>Drive/Reverse</em></li><li>Manual Transmission Neutral Status: <em>Neutral/Clutch</em> In or <em>In Gear</em></li><li>Glow Plug Lamp Status: Indicator <em>On</em> or <em>Off</em></li><li>Recommended Transmission Gear: <em>1</em> through <em>15</em></li></ol><strong>Note:</strong> Support for this datapoint is relatively rare, most vehicle report transmission status through non-standard enhanced live data</td></tr><tr><td>Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT)</td><td>Depending on the vehicle the followng parameters may be reported for each exhaust bank:<ol><li>Sensor #1 -
